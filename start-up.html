            <p>Ever wanted an app which can completely Guide you everthing related to your trip? <br>
               Exactly the same thing I want to make which will give you all the information and suggestions related to the trip which you are planning.
               You just need to give the basic information according to your requirements.  So basically the app will be your Travel search engine. Simply It will make the whole iternary for you.
            </p>

                 <div class="img1">
            <img src="./images/start-up_location2.jpg" alt="" >   
        </div>

        <div class="text1">
            <p> Basically first of all the app will fetch the data through Web API <br> related to your destination. Now if you choose the route to reach your <br> destination then it will dispaly you the best booking tivkets for you. <br> Simply book it and go further. Then if you mention that you want to <br> visit new places at your destination and you are plannig for 2 days halt, <br> then it display you the best visiting places for your destination and the <br> best hotels at which you can stay. Again you can simply book the tickets <br> for hotels and also the tickets for the place you want to visit. So in this <br> way your whole iternary will get planned slowly and gradually through <br> an app only.
