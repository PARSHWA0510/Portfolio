             <p> I love playing basketball in my free time. It is really a very challenging game.
                 The reason it is exciting is because you have to observe the other teams play, and try to make your own play
                  so you can break their plays, and get ball and score more points so you can win the game.</p>

            <p> I like to play badminton in court very much. 
                This game involves the whole body, you have to make fast moves to shuffle the shuttlecock which needs a high stamina and strength.  </p>

            <p>Something that has been really close to my heart since I was a kid, is already one of the most popular and renowned sports in the world, Volleyball. Whenever I get a chance to play it, I just grab the opportunity to get on the field. It always gives me a feeling of happiness and peace. Whenever I'm stressed out, its definitely one of the ways I cope up the stress with.  </p>
